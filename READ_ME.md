## Features
On our website Whoopdeedoo you can play numerous quizzes all about trivia.
To start you have to register and select wich country you live in or you can just log in if you already have an account.
After you have been logged in you can choose to start a game, view the rankings of your or any other country or to look at your profile and change your password or country.
When you want to play a game you can select a difficulty and a category.
If you choose a higher difficulty you will be rewarded with more points.
In the game you get four options to choose from. You have 20 seconds to awnser or you will recieve no points at all for that question.
When you have awnsered ten questions you will see your total score and you can play again or look at the rankings.
You will see there is a neat little java implementation on the login/register screen where register will be blurred untill you move your cursor over it.

### Contributions
The biggest part of the HTML pages, CSS and Javascript were made by Morris and partly by Tom and Jonas.
Most of the Python code and the database queries were written by Tom and Jonas because Morris wasn't very familiar with python at te time.
This resulted in a good mix of skills wich have led to an amazing product.

### Repository
The structure of our repository is quite easy.
The main python application is in the main folder, together with our helpers file and the database.
All our HTML pages are located in the templates folder. Our CSS stylesheets, images and our Javascript are all in the folder static.
In Helpers are some of the functions we needed throughout the making of our website.
